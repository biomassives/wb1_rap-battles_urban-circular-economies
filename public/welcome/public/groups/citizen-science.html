<h1>Citizen Science & Data</h1>

<p>Love this direction. Here&rsquo;s a <strong>single, long-form citizen science page</strong> you can drop straight into one of your pages (HTML or Markdown). It&rsquo;s written to <strong>introduce the mission, explain the focus areas, and actively invite participation</strong>&mdash;not just passive reading.</p>
<p>You can trim, re-section, or break it into components later.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Citizen Science for a Repairable Planet</h1>
<p><strong>Join the work. Share the knowledge. Build what lasts.</strong></p>
<p>We are building a citizen-led research and action network focused on practical solutions to climate stress, resource waste, and ecological breakdown. This is not an academic exercise and it&rsquo;s not a marketing campaign&mdash;it&rsquo;s a working collaboration between people who care enough to measure, document, test, and improve the systems we all depend on.</p>
<p>Our approach blends <strong>hands-on experimentation</strong>, <strong>open documentation</strong>, and <strong>collective pressure</strong>&mdash;because real change happens when evidence, practice, and public accountability reinforce one another.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a builder, mapper, researcher, organizer, tinkerer, student, or simply curious, there is a place for you here.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What We Mean by &ldquo;Citizen Science&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Citizen science means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Measuring real conditions where people actually live</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing results openly and reproducibly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning across disciplines instead of siloing expertise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing solutions that can be built, repaired, and improved locally</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need formal credentials. You <em>do</em> need curiosity, care, and a willingness to document what you observe.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Our Core Focus Areas</h2>
<h3>☀️ Solar Heating &amp; Passive Energy</h3>
<p>We explore low-cost, decentralized solar heating approaches that reduce energy demand before adding complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Passive solar design and retrofits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solar thermal collectors (DIY and commercial)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seasonal heat storage concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urban and off-grid applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Citizen science angle:</strong><br />Measure temperature gains, efficiency, durability, and real-world performance across climates and building types. Share build logs, failures, and improvements&mdash;not just successes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🔥 Rocket Stoves &amp; Efficient Biomass Use</h3>
<p>Rocket stoves demonstrate how much energy is wasted by poorly designed combustion systems.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High-efficiency stove designs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emissions reduction and air quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local materials and repairability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural and regional cooking needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Citizen science angle:</strong><br />Document fuel use, smoke levels, cooking time, and long-term wear. Compare designs. Improve safety and usability collaboratively.</p>
<hr />
<h3>💧 Water Systems &amp; Cross-Connection Mapping</h3>
<p>Water infrastructure is aging, opaque, and often poorly documented&mdash;especially at the local level.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cross-connections between potable, gray, and storm water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mapping leaks, contamination risks, and pressure issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community-scale reuse systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience during outages and floods</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Citizen science angle:</strong><br />Create shared maps, audit local systems, and surface hidden dependencies. This knowledge empowers communities and improves public accountability.</p>
<hr />
<h3>♻️ Plastics Reuse, Upcycling &amp; Material Flows</h3>
<p>Plastics aren&rsquo;t just a waste problem&mdash;they&rsquo;re a design failure.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Local plastic waste streams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting, shredding, melting, and reuse methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product redesign for reuse and repair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microplastic sources and mitigation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Citizen science angle:</strong><br />Track what types of plastic appear where, what <em>actually</em> gets recycled, and what doesn&rsquo;t. Experiment with reuse pathways that make economic and ecological sense.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🌱 Biodiversity, Policy &amp; Corporate Accountability</h3>
<p>Good data changes the conversation&mdash;but only if it&rsquo;s visible and shared.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporate waste practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government policy gaps and enforcement failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental justice impacts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Citizen science angle:</strong><br />Collect evidence. Correlate impacts. Publish findings in plain language. Use shared data to pressure institutions toward better outcomes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How Working Groups Collaborate</h2>
<p>Each focus area operates as a <strong>working group</strong>, but no group works in isolation.</p>
<p>We actively encourage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cross-posting findings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared tools and methodologies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joint projects (e.g. solar + water, plastics + policy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer review from outside your discipline</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This network effect is the point.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ways to Participate</h2>
<p>You can contribute by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining a working group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing observations, measurements, or experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building or testing designs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mapping local systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing guides or documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewing and improving others&rsquo; work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping coordinate or facilitate a group</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Small contributions matter. Consistent contributions matter more.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What We Value</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency over perfection</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repair over replacement</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence over opinion</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration over credit</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-term thinking over short-term wins</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is slow work done carefully&mdash;but it scales through shared effort.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>Choose a working group that resonates with you, or propose a new one if you see a gap. Introduce yourself, share what you&rsquo;re curious about, and start contributing at a pace that&rsquo;s sustainable.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need permission to begin&mdash;just a willingness to document what you learn and share it openly.</p>
<p><strong>The systems around us won&rsquo;t fix themselves.<br />But together, we can understand them&mdash;and rebuild them better.</strong></p>
