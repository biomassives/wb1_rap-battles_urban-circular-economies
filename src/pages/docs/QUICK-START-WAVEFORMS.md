## 💡 Tips

**Best File Size**: 100KB - 500KB
**Format**: WAV (16-bit, 44.1kHz, mono)
**Duration**: 1-5 seconds ideal
**Storage**: ~10-15 custom files comfortable

**Make files smaller:**
- Convert stereo → mono (halves size)
- Use 44.1kHz sample rate
- Keep samples short

## 🎛️ Using Custom Samples

1. Upload file → Shows in slot
2. Save custom bank → Stores in browser
3. Click pad → Load your sample
4. Press PLAY → Hear it!

Works exactly like built-in samples, but with your audio!
